# Pots Manager

**_Linux Container Agent Based on Docker Container Engine_**

Pots Manager lets you deploy and manage multiple container based clusters and provides
the scenario of managing your resources capacity. Also it provides networking scenario 
to connect multiple containers on different physical machines to facilitate network
connectivity between containers (Micro-services). Currently Cloud Pots supports Google
Compute Engine as Infrastructure as a Service or (IaaS) service provider to start pots 
manager but we are working to support multiple service providers to keep it running 
on hybrid service providers.
